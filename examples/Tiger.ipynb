    "This tutorial outlines how to define a POMDP using the [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/sisl/POMDPs.jl) interface. We will go through a simple problem simply known as the tiger problem (we will refer to it as the tiger POMDP). After defining the tiger POMDP, we will use QMDP and SARSOP to solve the POMDP."

    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "In the tiger POMDP, the agent is tasked with escaping from a room. There are two doors leading out of the room. Behind one of the doors is a tiger, and behind the other is sweet, sweet freedom. If the agent opens the door and finds the tiger, it gets eaten (and receives a reward of -100). If the agent opens the other door, it escapes and receives a reward of 10. The agent can also listen. Listening gives a noisy measuremnt of which door the tiger is hiding behind. Listening gives the agent the correct location of the tiger 85% of the time. The agent receives a reward of -1 for listening. "
